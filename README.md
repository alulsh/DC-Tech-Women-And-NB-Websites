## About
This is a collection of personal and portfolio websites of women and non-binary people in the Washington, D.C. technology community. It not only serves as a resource and inspiration for people creating their own personal or portfolio websites, but also showcases the collective accomplishments of women (cis and trans) and non-binary people in the Washington, D.C. technology community.

## I want to submit my website
You can submit your personal or portfolio website to the list in two ways:

1. Send an email to [alexandra.ulsh@gmail.com](mailto:alexandra.ulsh@gmail.com) 
2. Fork the repository, add your name and website to the JSON file, then initiate a pull request.

The JSON file is sorted alphabetically via the DataTables plug-in - there is no need to add it alphabetically in the JSON file. 

## I want to create my own website
Awesome! Check out my [slides on creating and hosting your own website](http://slides.com/alexandraulsh/build-your-own-website-with-cloud9-and-github-pages/) using Cloud9 and GitHub Pages.

Also, come to [Women Who Code DC](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/)'s weekly Front End Hack Night meetup? We are happy to help you out with creating your own website and other front end projects.

## Configuration Information
All of the website information is stored in a JSON file, then displayed on index.html via the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plug-in.
